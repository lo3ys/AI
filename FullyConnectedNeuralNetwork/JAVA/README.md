#**USABLE [BETA]**

###this is the new **fully connected neural network** class **|VERSION :1.3|**.

I will surely improve the library with time to make the network handle more complex structure (as injecting input in the hidden layer) and training (adaptative learning rate, genetic algorithm etc ...).

**EDIT :** I don't think I will add more complex structure as there are now the [free structure neural network](https://github.com/netscape-swega/AI/tree/master/FreeStructureNeuralNetwork/java).

Don't forget to download the [utilities](https://github.com/netscape-swega/AI/tree/master/library/java) library with the NeuralNet library or the library will not work.

the library jar file was moved [here](https://github.com/netscape-swega/AI/tree/master/library/java).
