#**USABLE [ALPHA]**

###this is the new **neural network** class **|VERSION :1.1|**.

I will surely improve the library with time to make the network handle more complex structure (as injecting input in the hidden layer) and training (adaptative learning rate, genetic algorithm etc ...).

Don't forget to download the [utilities](https://github.com/netscape-swega/AI/tree/master/Utilities/java) library with the NeuralNet library or the library will not work.
