**USABLE**

Detailed Neural Network with a Matrix class for calculation.


work on processing 
I work on a pure java version

for using  contructor : 

input number, output number, array of hidden (for example {6,9,4} for three later of 6 ,9 and 4 neurons)


.set_FeedForward : for changing activation function ( 0 = contant , infinity = linear ) and learning rate

.reset (assign random value)

.calculate : input array 
make a prediction

.train : input array, target
train the network 

can't work without matrix class
