#**USABLE [ALPHA]**

###this is the **free connected neural network** class **|VERSION :1.0|**.

I will try to add genetic algorithm soon for this network.

I did not test it (except for very simple tests as XOR)
so it may have some issue.

also do not try to connect neuron to higher layer neuron, it will surely mess up the network.

I didn't do error check everywhere (because it's a pain to do).
so you cany do some stuff that the network cannot handle.

also the new SoftMax activation function that i add to the Utilities Library did not work for this networks.

Don't forget to download the [utilities](https://github.com/netscape-swega/AI/tree/master/library/java) library with the NeuralNet library or the library will not work.

the structure of the network is inspired by this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmCtSidJ7aY).
